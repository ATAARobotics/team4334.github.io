            <h1>What is an AMA?</h1>
            <p>An AMA, short for Ask Me Anything, is an event open to the public where everyone is free to submit questions to a specific group of people.
            AMAs have a variety of purposes, from raising awareness for causes to providing public information. Ours is a bit of both: talk with members of <i>FIRST</i> Robotics Teams 4334 and 5015 to learn more about <i>FIRST</i> Robotics, their experiences, and the skills they learned!</p>
