This holiday season members of Team 4334 spent their Saturday helping the Salvation Army with it's annual Toy Distribution. The charity, which gives Christmas gifts to families in need was happy to have Alberta Tech Alliance help for the third consecutive year. The team helped by sorting gifts, preparing packages and doing a variety of other tasks. The rest of the photos from the event can be found [here](/2015/12/12/salvation-army-photos/)
