Based on guidance from the Center for Disease Control, the World Health Organization, and other health officials <i>FIRST</i> has chosen to postpone the 2020 Season in light of the spread of COVID-19, or the Coronavirus. This involves postponing all planned Regional competitions and cancelling of both Championship events. This response includes the postponement of the ATA's performance in the Canadian Rockies Regional. More information can be found [here.] (https://www.firstinspires.org/covid-19)

Based on similar guidance from Alberta Health Services, the Alberta Government, and the City of Calgary, ATA has chosen to close their buildspace while the danger of COVID-19 continues. We will re-open when a safe opportunity to do so occurs and we will continue in our efforts to inspire and empower youth in technology, engineering, and robotics during and after this closure.
