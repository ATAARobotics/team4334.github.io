We're axiously awaiting this next monday for the very first meeting of the year for ATA. We'll be going over the basics of what FRC is, and what being on the team is like. We hope to catch the attention of new students this year!

Hopefully, we will attain our goal of 50+ students at the first meeting. We have posters around the school and announcements running throughtout the day. We want to hype this up as much as we can.

So if you go to Bishop Carroll (or even if you don't!), come check us out. We're always looking for new recruits.
