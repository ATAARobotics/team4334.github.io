ATA and our sister team 5015 SWAT Bots competed at the Canadian Rockies Regional in Calgary last weekend. 37 teams from Canada, Mexico, Turkey, Australia, China, and America were in attendance. ATA finished qualifications in 11th place and was chosen by team 6351 Rundle Collage Robotics to be part of the fourth place alliance. Team 5078 ROBO-KAOS was chosen as our second pick. We were eliminated by the eventual regional winners in the semifinals.

We finished this season with a record of 19 wins, 10 losses, and 1 tie. We are grateful to all of the help we have received from our sponsors, alliance partners, parents, and other supporters. Congratulations to the regional winners, 359 Hawaiian Kids, 2122 Team Tators, and 6841 Cerberus 2.0, and all of the other award winners.
