At our last meeting new members of team 4334 had the opportunity to rebuild the base of our 2013 robot. Given pictures, parts, and some help from returning members students managed to build a driving base using the parts from last year's robot. This proved a valuable experience for fabrication and assembly students, who got a better of idea of how building a robot works. More photos from the build can be found [here](/2013/11/20/robot-rebuild/).
