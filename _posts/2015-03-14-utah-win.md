We are happy to announce our competition in Salt Lake City, Utah, was an astounding success! Our alliance came in first at the regional and we are highly anticipating our trip to St. Louis to compete at the Championship. Our alliance was composed of Team 624 CRyptonite from Texas and Team 1619 Up-A-Creek from Colorado. We utilized each of our robots' capabilities to create a unbeatable team with which we won all of the final matches. The photos from the event can be found [here](/2015/03/14/utah-photos/).
