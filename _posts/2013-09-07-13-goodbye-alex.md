This year, we say goodbye to our original member, Alex Rodriguez. We're happy to see him pursuing his passion in Waterloo University. He'll be continuing in FRC on Team 1114, Simbotics.

Alex is the reason that this team exists. He came from Bishop Grandin's team, a local school in Calgary who has had a robotics team for years. He wanted to create a competitive team at Bishop Carroll, and he did so almost single-handedly. Our team's first year was one of the most successful in rookie history, and we attribute that mainly to Alex's dedication.

ATA will always keep Alex's passion for robotics, and will try to honour the legacy he created.

"I sincerely hope to do half as well as Alex did in his two short years on Team 4334. We hope to push success in the following years."
-Joel Gallant, New Team Leader

Thank you Alex, for everything you did for us!
