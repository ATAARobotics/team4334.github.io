Team 4334 is very grateful to have been part of the China Urban Youth Robotics
Association, Robotics Maker Camp. It was an amazing opportunity to have worked
with aspiring rookie teams 9031 and 9049 whom we will see at the China Regional
in 2017.

We were also invited to participate in the China Robotics Challenge were we won
with our amazing alliance 1538 - The Holy Cows, 9025 - Superman, and 5522 -
Stargazer.

Thank you to all of those that made this possible for us.
