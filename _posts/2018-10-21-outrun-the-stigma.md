Outrun the Stigma is an annual run/walk that raises thousands of dollars every year to fight the stigma surrounding mental health in Canada. Around 2,800 people participate in the run/walk every year in Calgary and Edmonton. Outrun the Stigma started as a student group at the University of Calgary in 2013 and grew to become a not-for-profit group. At this event, ATA was able to promote our team and FIRST to participants and their families. View the photos from the event [here.](/media/photos)
