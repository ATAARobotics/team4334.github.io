Team 4334 is proud to make its resources available for all teams to use.

## Our Projects

- [Gordian](https://github.com/Team4334/gordian) - Basic scripting language for portable programs with no external dependencies.
- [atalibj](https://github.com/Team4334/atalibj) - ATA's abstract FRC libraries (Java)
- [Scouting13](https://github.com/joelg236/Scouting13) - ATA's Java swing application used for scouting at competitions. Saves data as a custom data type which can be compiled into csv files.
- [FRC West Curriculum](http://frc-west.github.io/) - FRC Western Canada's official courses that earn high school credits, written solely by a team 4334 member

We plan to make curriculum for all sub-teams and make it available for free here.
