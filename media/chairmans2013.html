			<p>&ldquo;There is but one degree of commitment; total.&rdquo; -Arnie 
			Sherr</p>
			<p>Team 4334, Alberta Tech Alliance takes pride in our exemplification 
			of dedication and commitment. This commitment has fueled our drive to 
			be a team that exemplifies both FIRST and its mission.</p>
			<p>The main sources of our dedication to both FIRST and the team would 
			be our team&rsquo;s attitudes of independence and self-direction. The 
			leadership skills learned through our involvement in FIRST led to our 
			team members playing an essential role in the creation of the Western 
			Canada regional and 12 rookie teams, as well as being part of the regional 
			planning committee. Our Archimedes Division win at the World Championships 
			and our win at the Indiana Robotics Invitational show that we have just 
			as much dedication on the field as we do off. In addition to these achievements, 
			we won the Rookie All-Star at GTR east and have been dubbed a &ldquo;True 
			Rookie All-Star&rdquo; by Karthik Kanagasabapathy, Lead Mentor of Team 
			1114.</p>
			<p>The Alberta Tech Alliance began nearly two years ago with the simple 
			goal of creating a second FRC team in Calgary and bringing a working 
			robot to an event. From this humble beginning we went on to being one 
			of the five rookie teams to have made it onto the Einstein Field. While 
			we were inwardly focused during the course of our first build season, 
			we quickly came to realize the importance of outreach. This new focus 
			culminated in a number of new endeavors for our team.</p>
			<p>Our first outreach pursuits involved being featured on many local 
			TV news stations and newspapers. The news outlets that have featured 
			us include CBC, Global, Metro, CTV, Shaw, and Calgary Herald. These 
			numerous segments were seen by tens of thousands, encouraging further 
			enrollment in FIRST in Calgary. In addition to the media coverage, our 
			team spread the word about FIRST through demonstrations at school events. 
			For example, our school&rsquo;s annual open house, where dozens of prospective 
			high school students had a chance to see the robot and the team.</p>
			<p>Team 4334&rsquo;s dedication to spread FIRST&rsquo;s mission has 
			lead to multiple demonstrations at events in our local area. In August 
			of 2012 we partnered with the regional director and ran a booth at the 
			Inglewood Sunfest, an event with over 30,000 people in attendance. This 
			gave us the opportunity to recruit dozens of volunteers, mentors, and 
			prospective students. Later that year, in September, we attended the 
			YYC Maker Faire which helped us to expose our team to hundreds of technically 
			minded and influential people such as Jay Ingram and Rahim Sajan, a 
			local Member of Parliament candidate. Both of these events led to over 
			40 people signing up to be students, mentors, and volunteers in time 
			for the 2013 season.</p>
			<p>The Alberta Tech Alliance has taken on numerous tasks to help teams 
			both locally and internationally in the past year. Although we started 
			with practically no knowledge of robotics, we quickly grew to be quite 
			capable of helping other teams. We began helping others by releasing 
			our robot code at the end of last year, which got over one hundred downloads. 
			Later that year, we began helping rookie teams in a more direct manner 
			by teaching a programming seminar with 82 representatives from every 
			rookie team in Alberta organized by the regional director. This created 
			the foundation for us mentoring ten teams from Calgary through email 
			and two teams through on-site assistance. To help teams with scouting 
			we created desktop and Android scouting apps with over 350 combined 
			downloads by teams in four different countries. Finally, near the end 
			of this year&rsquo;s build season we released ATAlibj, a robust robot 
			code base.</p>
			<p>Since our founding, our students have had a level of independence 
			and self-direction nearly unparalleled in the world of FIRST. Although 
			we are aided by extremely knowledgeable mentors from SAIT and our other 
			sponsors, the students are the true leaders on Team 4334. Since nearly 
			all of our students come from the self-directed learning school Bishop 
			Carroll, our team has a culture of &ldquo;self-learning&rdquo; that 
			encourages students to, with the help of mentors, address their problems 
			in an independent manner. This attitude means that all of the team&rsquo;s 
			outreach and robot design efforts have been student led and motivated. 
			In addition, our determined nature has led to veteran students teaching 
			organized classes to new members in numerous fields.</p>
			<p>The ability to communicate on a local and community level has been 
			a challenge for our team due to our independent attitude. We have dealt 
			with the challenge of internal communication in numerous innovative 
			ways. Our team uses email lists and Facebook groups to collaborate effectively 
			on matters relating to the robot and other important topics. To facilitate 
			fast and simple collaboration we use Dropbox to share CAD models, Google 
			Drive to collaborate on documents, and GitHub for software version control. 
			Our team&rsquo;s external communication techniques include social media 
			such as Facebook and Twitter, where we have gained over four hundred 
			likes and followers combined. Additionally, on the last day of our 2013 
			build season we invited SAIT employees to see our 2013 robot and exposed 
			over ten extremely influential local industry professionals to FIRST.</p>
			<p>One of the main factors enabling our success is our partnership with 
			our local polytechnic, SAIT (Southern Alberta Institute of Technology). 
			This partnership was crucial to the creation of the team since SAIT 
			provided the facilities and resources needed to complete our build season. 
			In addition to materials, facilities, and machines SAIT also provided 
			us access to mentors in fabrication, CAD, and robotics last year. This 
			partnership has continued into our second build season with SAIT giving 
			us a large and well equipped build space in their new building. Our 
			partnerships extend beyond SAIT as well, with organizations and companies 
			such as Pason, Triumph, and the Government of Alberta offering finances 
			and mentorship. These partnerships are mutually beneficial because we 
			have given many of our sponsors exposure through advertising on our 
			robot and apparel.</p>
			<p>The Alberta Tech Alliance is continually striving towards being a 
			model for other teams to emulate through our efforts to help others 
			and spread FIRST&rsquo;s message. Furthermore, through our scouting 
			app, appearances at public events, and mentoring of other teams we have 
			already made a considerable impact on the FIRST community and society 
			at large. We are ready to move past our Rookie All-Star status and become 
			an inspiration for other teams.</p>
