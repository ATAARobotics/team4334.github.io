			a culture of encouraging youth to pursue and respect science and technology 
			and has programs for a variety of age ranges.</p>

			<p>For Team 4334 - Alberta Tech Alliance (ATA) cooperation and progress 
			have been consistent themes in our development since our inception. 
			This progress has led to the expansion of outreach programs and the 
			internal development of our team.</p>
			<p>Improvement has been a critical part of Team 4334&rsquo;s three years 
			of operation as we have continually strived to be better leaders in 
			our local&nbsp;<em>FIRST</em>community. During these years, our student 
			led approach has resulted in a number of successes both on and off the 
			field. In competition, our achievements include a World Championship 
			divisional win, a regional win, and a win at the Indiana Robotics Invitational. 
			We have also become key elements in the growth and creation of the Western 
			Canada&nbsp;<em>FIRST</em>&nbsp;community with team members being part 
			of the region&rsquo;s inaugural regional planning committee and being 
			mentors for other teams.</p>
			<p>Alberta Tech Alliance has been a force for the expansion of&nbsp;<em>FIRST</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>FIRST</em>&nbsp;teams 
			since our formation in 2011. In the past two years we have helped 10 
			FRC teams through email, 5 of which with further on-site mentorship. 
			We have also provided speakers at 3 different workshops teaching a variety 
			of topics including scouting, strategy and programming to over 300 students 
			and mentors. Furthermore, we have helped teams by guiding them through 
			the kitbot build process during kickoff and providing them with a practice 
			field later in the season. Similarly, we have encouraged the growth 
			of&nbsp;<em>FIRST</em>Lego League in our area by funding 10 FLL teams 
			in 2013.</p>
			<p>In the past two years we have created a variety of tools to help 
			teams both locally and abroad. To help teams scout effectively we have 
			published numerous tools, including desktop and Android scouting programs 
			and scouting sheet templates. Altogether our tools had over 600 downloads 
			last year. In order to help teams with programming we created an open-source 
			code base in Java and C++ that gave teams greater programming versatility. 
			Additionally, we released Gordian, an autonomous scripting language, 
			as a tool for teams to easily change their autonomous code. These projects 
			were part of the&nbsp;<em>FIRST</em>&nbsp;Summer of Code and were further 
			improved by members of other teams as part of a collaborative effort.</p>
			<p>On Alberta Tech Alliance team members are dedicated to&nbsp;<em>FIRST</em>. 
			In the past two years, there have been four Team 4334 parents and students 
			on the Western Canada Regional planning committee. Additionally, out 
			of the 11 key leadership roles at the Calgary regional, 6 of them are 
			filled by our parents and former students. Over the summer, a member 
			of Alberta Tech Alliance developed the FRC curriculum for Alberta as 
			part of an internship for FRC West. In addition to creating the curriculum, 
			this student also created and maintained the FRC West website.</p>
			<p>To promote the growth of FRC in Alberta, Team 4334 has created a 
			sustainable funding model that is applicable in Alberta, the Northwest 
			Territories, and Nunavut. The funding model uses the Alberta Education 
			curriculum developed by a Team 4334 member to fund FRC teams. The curriculum, 
			which teaches programming, electronics and general robotics information, 
			gives students Alberta Education Credits upon completion, which students 
			need in order to fulfill their graduation requirements. The money that 
			is awarded by Alberta Education to schools for the successful completion 
			of courses is then split between the team and school for a total of 
			$500 per student. This was successfully used to fully fund 9 teams in 
			2014.</p>
			<p>Many members of Team 4334 have used the skills and dedication they 
			learned on the team for personal success. Last year, members from our 
			team received the Woodie Flowers Award, Deans list award and an FRC 
			scholarship for the University of Calgary. The success of ATA students 
			often continues after their FRC experience. For example, a former student 
			won a gold medal in Precision Machining at the 19th Skills Canada National 
			Competition in June of 2013. Another example would be our graduating 
			class of 2013 who all either attend or plan to attend a university within 
			the next year.</p>
			<p>Since our creation, we have encouraged public interest at numerous 
			local events including Sunfest, YYC Maker Faire, Calgary Comic-Expo, 
			and Beakerhead. These events had a combined attendance of over 90000 
			people and have proven successful in recruiting mentors and students 
			for FRC West. Additionally, at Bricktastrophy our team had the opportunity 
			to spark interest for FRC among the FLL students and forge connections 
			with the Honorable Teresa Woo-Paw, the Associate Minister of International 
			and Intergovernmental Relations. In April of 2013 ATA had the opportunity 
			along with three other FRC teams to host a weekend long&nbsp;<em>FIRST</em>&nbsp;exhibit 
			at the Telus Spark, our local science centre. This exhibit demonstrated&nbsp;<em>FIRST</em>&nbsp;to 
			over 1000 people. Our team has also been featured in a number of news 
			publications including CTV, CBC, Global and The Calgary Herald, in addition 
			to being promoted by Ultimate Rob, a professional frisbee player. Our 
			public presence also includes social media sites such as our Facebook 
			and Twitter pages, where we have over 700 combined likes and followers.</p>
			<p>To complement our public exhibitions, Team 4334 has also given private 
			presentations to various influential individuals and organizations. 
			In 2013, we gave presentations to both the Calgary Board of Education 
			and the Calgary Separate School District, in order to encourage the 
			further creation of teams in Calgary. We have also given presentations 
			on FRC to the executives of a number of companies including August Electronics, 
			Worldplay, and Home Solutions. In order to expose those from other youth 
			organizations to&nbsp;<em>FIRST</em>&nbsp;we have given presentations 
			to both local scout troops and 4-H leaders.</p>
			<p>Charity and relief have become important parts of Team 4334&rsquo;s 
			philosophy in the past year. When the 2013 Alberta Floods devastated 
			many communities in Calgary and High River, ATA&rsquo;s members rose 
			to the challenge. In Calgary, our members became part of the flood relief 
			effort by helping clear water and damaged wood out of homes in the community 
			of Bowness. The team also used our Facebook page in order to help the 
			flood gain publicity with the FRC community and one of our members created 
			the www.helphighriver.com donation page in order to help raise aid for 
			the city of High River. In addition to helping with the flood relief 
			effort, Alberta Tech Alliance members volunteered for the Salvation 
			Army Toy Drive in order to help more kids in Calgary enjoy the holidays.</p>
			<p>Team 4334&rsquo;s accomplishments are made possible through a collaboration 
			of students, parents, mentors and sponsors. To prepare our rookie students 
			for build season our senior students take leadership initiative by teaching 
			classes in everything from CAD to PR. Our senior students also displayed 
			leadership this year through the implementation of rookie-senior pairs 
			in which senior students gave individualized advice and leadership to 
			their paired rookie. This system greatly improved the rookie retention 
			rate from the previous year. We have also collaborated with parents 
			to have food and supervision provided at the build season. Additionally, 
			we received an in-kind sponsorship with our local Tim Hortons to provide 
			food when parents are unavailable. To facilitate the communication and 
			cooperation of these groups we use a variety of tools including Dropbox, 
			Google Drive and weekly email updates to all parents and students. Our 
			communication has also improved through the use of year-end meetings 
			to recapitulate the completed season and plan for the next season with 
			parents, students and sponsors.</p>
			<p>Our relationship with our sponsors has been a key factor in the survival 
			and success of our team. Our team has had over 10 sponsors since our 
			creation, providing both in-kind and fundraising services. Furthermore, 
			our efforts to build relationships with the AO Shirley Foundation Board 
			have resulted in a 5 year sponsorship commitment. These sponsors have 
			been critical to the team&rsquo;s funding and robot building capabilities. 
			In-kind sponsorship, such as machining, materials and food, have proven 
			invaluable to the operation of our team. In exchange for these valuable 
			services we provide sponsors with publicity through features on our 
			t-shirts, banners and robots. We have also formed a partnership with 
			FRC West to pay for a practice field, which is available to all teams 
			in Alberta, as well as a space for two local community-based teams to 
			build.</p>
			<p>Cooperation, progress, and leadership have become key virtues of 
			Team 4334. Our mentorship of teams, commitment to charity and dedication 
			to the promotion and growth of&nbsp;<em>FIRST</em>&nbsp;clearly demonstrate 
			this. Our unyielding enthusiasm for excellence will continue to drive 
			our progress as we seek to realize the mission of&nbsp;<em>FIRST</em>.</p>
