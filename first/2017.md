In *FIRST* STEAMWORKS, two Alliances of three robots each are on a mission to prepare for a long-distance air ship travel! Robots score points by gathering gears and placing them on the pegs of the airship for the pilots to place into spot to spin rotors or gather fuel and shot it either into the high boiler or the low boiler. In the last 30 seconds the robots can climb onto the airship to join on its voyage!
